The following are the key steps performed in the ETL pipeline:

Extract: This process collects and integrates data from a variety of sources, including Databases, Data Lakes, CRMs, and others.
Transform: This is the most crucial phase in an ETL Pipeline. To make data, analytics-ready, it must be properly gathered, sorted, cleaned, and pivoted, in this step.
Load: This process involves importing structured or unstructured data from Data Lakes, Databases, and other sources into Data Warehouses so that Data Analysts or other users can gain deep insights easily.
